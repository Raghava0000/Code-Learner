            A recent post on Weibo suggested that Apple will increase the prices of the iPhone 15 Pro models. This will be a
            part of its strategy to maintain a price gap between the standard and the Pro variants of the lot.<br>
    
            Reiterating the same, we have a recent report by Forbes, which hints at a $300 gap between the non-Pro and Pro
            models. The silver lining is that the iPhone 15 and the 15 Plus prices will remain the same as the iPhone 14 and
            14 Plus.
